Rain Collector

Outside board is panStamp plugged into a PCB which monitors temp of two heating pads, temp inside rain collector and temp below rain collector.  It also monitors pulses from rain collector and closes a relay for every pulse for the Davis Weather station.  Data is wirelessly sent to the panStamp on the inside. 

The inside panStamp is connected to an Ethernet module which posts the data on Xively.
